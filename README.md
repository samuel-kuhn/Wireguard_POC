# Wireguard POC

## Configuration

This repository was developed and tested with the following setup:

Two **Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS** virtual machines were created in VirtualBox Version 7.2.2. 

Both virtual machines were set to use the `Bridged Adapter`.

## Quick start

Copy the repository to the `/root` folder and execute the scripts [client.sh](client.sh) and [server.sh](server.sh) as `root` on either of the machines.

Both installations should be run at the same time to view and enter the machines public keys in the terminal prompt.
